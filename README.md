# Project Tour Waving Robot
After years of it being joked about the SSE is finally getting a robotic arm to wave at tours.  Join the slack channel or attend a meeting in the SSE Fridays at 2!

  With finals now over and the new semester started, we are back on track for finishing the arm very soon. A doc with inventory will be posted soon so we know what we have left to print and our servo components will be completed in the near future. Motors and arduino have all been tested and are ready to go.
  
  Due to co-op, if you have issues forking the repo, you can also contact Scott Frauenknecht (saf6260@rit.edu) or come to our regularly scheduled meeting time: Fridays at 2pm in the lab! Thanks!

  Printing is almost done!  Take a look in the pictures folder to see some of the stuff we've done so far.  With the last few things getting printed this week I hope to have the motors and arduino ordered early next week.  Everyone be ready to write some code soon!
  
  Please fork this repo so we can all work on the code for the motors.  If you don't know how to fork the repo please contact Peyton Schmidt (pcs7709@rit.edu).  See you all in the lab!
